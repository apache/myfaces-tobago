# Apache Tobago

Apache MyFaces Tobago is a JSF component framework that pays special attention to security and is optimized for
business applications.

Tobago supports custom themes based on the popular Bootstrap framework and frees the user from having to develop
complex CSS and JavaScript components.

Compared to many other JSF frameworks, Tobago is still being actively developed and is used in many projects.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

* A Git client to check out this project (may part of your IDE)
* [JDK17]( https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads) or higher
* [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

## Building

In the project directory you can use:

```
mvn clean install
```

to build the project with all submodules.
This will put all necessary artifacts into your local repository.

If there are changes in the `tobago-theme` module in TypeScript or other sources,
you need to build with **frontend** profile:

```
mvn clean install -Pfrontend
```

## Live Demo

You can find a live demo of all components at [https://tobago-vm.apache.org/](https://tobago-vm.apache.org/).

## Examples

See `tobago-example` directory for some simple examples on how to use Tobago:

* [tobago-example-blank](tobago-example/tobago-example-blank) a minimal hello world application,
* [tobago-example-demo](tobago-example/tobago-example-demo) a demo and documentation application,
* [tobago-example-spring-boot](tobago-example/tobago-example-spring-boot) same demo using spring-boot.

**Demo**

```shell
mvn clean install
cd tobago-example/tobago-example-demo
