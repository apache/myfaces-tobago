  <p>
    Tobago supports Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent cross-site
    scripting (XSS) and related attacks.
    <tc:link link="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/" label="Specification link" image="bi-box-arrow-up-right"/>.
    In short: The HTML page doesn't contain any JavaScript or CSS information.
    All allowed sources for JavaScript, CSS and other resources have to be declared in special header.
    If you have own renderers or own JavaScript in your application, this code also needs to support CSP, to use this feature.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please define CSP in the <code>tobago-config.xml</code> file.
