  <p>
    After a page is loaded, some input element may have the focus, so the user
    can immediately begin typing information in the form. There is a ruleset to define
    which element have the focus, at first.
  </p>
  <p>
    The boolean focus attribute of an input field sets the focus to the element explicitly.
  </p>
  <p>
    The priority order is:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>error (the first error element gets the focus)</li>
    <li>auto (the element with the tobago tag attribute focus="true" gets the focus)</li>
    <li>last (the element from the last request with same id gets the focus, not AJAX)</li>
    <li>page (use the focusId attribute of the tc:page)</li>
    <li>first (the first input element (without tabindex=-1) gets the focus, not AJAX)</li>
  </ul>

</ui:composition>
