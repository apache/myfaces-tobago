    The file attribute of tc:style is not rendered after a submit.
  </p>

  <tc:panel>
    <tc:style customClass="demo-selected"/>
    <p>
      This box will be diplayed with background color #ffddff, because of the CSS class ".demo-selected".
      The color is defined in the local file "style/demo.css".
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The bug:</b> After a click of "reload" the style is broken, because the include of the demo.css is missing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem only occurs with <code>&lt;ui:include src="x-event-\#{''}.xhtml"/></code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem NOT occurs with <code>&lt;ui:include src="x-event-.xhtml"/></code>, but the EL should resolve to
      exactly the same string.
