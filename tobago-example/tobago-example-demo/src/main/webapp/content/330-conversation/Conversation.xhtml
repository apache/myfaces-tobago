  <p>This page show a simple example for the <code>@ConversationScoped</code> annotation.
    The <b>Conversationscope</b> is needed for situations when the controller must live longer than a single request,
    but don't need to live the whole session.</p>
  <p>A <code>@Inject Conversation conversation;</code> must be injected.
    After that a conversation can be started with <code>conversation.begin()</code> and stopped with
    <code>conversation.end()</code>.</p>

  <tc:box label="Example">
    <p>Counting up greater than '1' is only possible when a conversation is started.</p>
    <tc:out label="Conversation" value="#{conversationController.conversationStatus}"/>
    <tc:button label="Start Conversation" action="#{conversationController.beginConversation}"
               rendered="#{conversationController.conversationStatus == 'stopped'}"/>
    <tc:button label="Stop Conversation" action="#{conversationController.endConversation}"
               rendered="#{conversationController.conversationStatus == 'started'}"/>
