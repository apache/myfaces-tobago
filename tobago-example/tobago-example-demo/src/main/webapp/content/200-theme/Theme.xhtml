  <p>Tobago supports a big variety of displaying controls, so called designs or themes.</p>

  <p>It comes with several predefined themes, each with its own visual characteristics:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Standard Theme</b> - The default theme by Bootstrap to have a clean base to abstract from.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Scarborough</b> - Minimalistic standard theme with basic changes from the Standard Theme.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Speyside</b> - A nature-inspired theme with warm and earthy tones.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Roxborough</b> - A dark theme with high color contrast and bright accents.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Charlotteville</b> - A theme that comes with blue color tones which resemble the sky.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <tc:form id="theme">
    <tc:section label="Change Theme">
      <p>Choosing of themes can be application wide, user or group specific.
        Images and other resources can be theme dependant as well as the application pages can be designed separately
        for each supported theme.</p>
      <tc:selectOneChoice label="Theme" value="#{themeController.theme}">
        <f:selectItems value="#{themeController.themeItems}"/>

    <p>In Tobago it's easy to give an application a well designed look. You can use prepared themes like 'speyside' or
      'scarborough', just to name two. The only thing you have to do is configure them in the 'tobago-config.xml'.</p>

    <demo-highlight language="markup">&lt;tobago-config>

    &lt;default-theme>speyside&lt;/default-theme>
  &lt;/theme-config>
