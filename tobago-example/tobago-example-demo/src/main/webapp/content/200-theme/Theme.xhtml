  <p>Tobago supports a big variety of displaying controls, so called designs or themes.</p>

  <tc:form id="theme">
    <tc:section label="Change Theme">
      <p>Choosing of themes can be application wide, user or group specific.
        Images and other resources can be theme dependant as well as the application pages can be designed seperatly
        for each supported theme.</p>

        <tc:image value="/image/#{tobagoContext.theme.name}/theme-photo.jpg"/>
      </tc:figure>
    </tc:section>
  </tc:form>

  <tc:section label="Configuration">
    <p>In Tobago it's easy to give an application a well designed look. You can use prepared themes like 'speyside' or
      'scarborough', just to name two. The only thing you have to do is configure them in the 'tobago-config.xml'.</p>

    <demo-highlight language="markup">&lt;tobago-config>
  &lt;theme-config>
    &lt;default-theme>speyside&lt;/default-theme>
  &lt;/theme-config>
&lt;/tobago-config></demo-highlight>
