    All themes shipped with Tobago based on
    <tc:link label="Bootstrap" image="bi-bootstrap"/> (since Tobago 3).
  </p>

  <p>
    To customize the styles, Bootstrap classes are preferred.
    Tobago classes, application based classes or 3rd party classes and style may be used.

  <p>
    <tc:badge markup="warning" value="Warning:"/>
    In general, style customization should be used sparingly to make major updates easier.
