  This section describes how to build Tobago and run the example applications from the sources.

  <tc:section label="Checking Out">

    Check out the current development sources by running the following:

    <demo-highlight language="bash">$ git clone https://github.com/apache/myfaces-tobago tobago</demo-highlight>

    You can check out older versions like 2.x by using the git remote branch (tobago-2.x) running:

    <demo-highlight language="bash">$ git clone -b tobago-2.x https://github.com/apache/myfaces-tobago tobago-2.x</demo-highlight>

  </tc:section>

  <tc:section label="Building">

    <p>
      You need <tc:link label="Maven" link="http://maven.apache.org/download.html" image="bi-box-arrow-up-right"/> (at
      least version 3.0.4)
      and Java (version 8 or higher) to build Tobago.
    </p>

    <p>
      Change to the local loaded source directory and call
    </p>

    <demo-highlight language="bash">$ mvn clean install</demo-highlight>

    <p>
      to run the install target on all sub projects. This will
      download all necessary artifacts into your local Maven repository.
    </p>

  </tc:section>

  <tc:section label="Examples">

    You can run the examples inside tobago-example with jetty

    <demo-highlight language="bash">$ mvn jetty:run -Pjetty</demo-highlight>

    or

    <demo-highlight language="bash">$ mvn package</demo-highlight>

    and deploy the WAR from the target directory manually.

    <tc:section label="Using different JSF implementations">

      By default the example will be started with MyFaces 2.3 and Jetty 9.

      <demo-highlight language="bash">$ mvn jetty:run -Pjetty</demo-highlight>

      For Jetty 10 use the profile jee8.

      <demo-highlight language="bash">$ mvn jetty:run -Pjetty -Pjee8</demo-highlight>

      You can select a specific JSF implementation with the <i>jsf</i> variable, like Mojarra.

      <demo-highlight language="bash">$ mvn jetty:run -Djsf=mojarra-2.3</demo-highlight>
    </tc:section>

    It's also possible to run the demo in TomEE from Maven directly

    <demo-highlight language="bash">$ mvn clean package tomee:run -Ptomee -Djsf=provided</demo-highlight>

  </tc:section>

  <tc:section label="Development">
    <p>For development the example-demo could be run with maven profile "dev".</p>
    <demo-highlight language="bash">$ mvn -Pdev jetty:run -Pjetty</demo-highlight>
    <p>In this case the npm scripts "dev-css" and "dev-ts" could be run to compile css and typescript classes.
      These changes would be detected by jetty without restart.</p>
