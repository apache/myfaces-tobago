    By using Java and JSF with Facelets you have a good base to build secure applications.
    Tobago supports additional security concepts:

  <ul>
    <li><tc:link label="#{demoBundle.content_security_policy}"
                 outcome="/content/30-concept/80-security/05-csp/content-security-policy.xhtml"/></li>
    <li><tc:link label="#{demoBundle.sanitize}"
                 outcome="/content/30-concept/80-security/10-sanitize/sanitize.xhtml"/> suspicious code.
    </li>
    <li>Checking annotated method calls for <tc:link label="#{demoBundle.roles}"
                 outcome="/content/30-concept/80-security/20-roles/roles.xhtml"/>.</li>
    <li>Setting HTTP headers <code>X-Frame-Options</code> and <code>X-Content-Type-Options</code></li>
    <li>Using session secrects to avoid
      <tc:link label="Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    link="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)" image="fa-external-link" />.
    This is configurable in the <code>tobago-config.xml</code></li>
