  <tc:section label="Description">
    <p>Tobago is a user interface framework for developing web applications.
      The technical basis of the framework is JavaServer Faces. The main core represents a theme oriented
      JSF Render Kit.</p>
    <tc:section label="Basic Controls">
      <p>Tobago provides all standard controls of HTML like inputs, textareas, radiobuttons, checkboxes and buttons.
        Additionally Tobago provides you with complex controls, which are not natively supported by simple HTML,
        including sheets, trees and tabs.</p>
    </tc:section>
    <tc:section label="Validation">
      <p>The main goal of Tobago is the development of applications which are interactive from the users point of view.
        Tobago makes it easy to validate input and helps the user to enter correct data.</p>
    </tc:section>
    <tc:section label="Layout">
      <p>Tobago provides several advanced layout managers to fit for specific use cases by using CSS3 and HTML5.
        This includes a 12 columns layout from <tc:link label="Bootstrap" link="https://getbootstrap.com/"/>
        and a flex layout which replace the old grid layout from Tobago 2.</p>

      <p>The Tobago project is using <tc:link label="semantic versioning" link="https://semver.org/"/> since past 2016.</p>
      <p>This will lead into more growing minor version number compared to the past.</p>
