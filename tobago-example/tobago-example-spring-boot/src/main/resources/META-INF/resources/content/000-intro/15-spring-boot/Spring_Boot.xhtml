    This is the Spring Boot variant of the Tobago demo.
  </p>
  <p>
    Quite all of the content comes from the sister project "tobago-example-demo" by a JAR dependency.
    Only this page and the simple
    <tc:link label="hello-spring.xhtml" link="#{request.contextPath}/hello-spring.xhtml"/>
    reside in this module.
  </p>
  <p>
    This example can be used to see, what you need for a Tobago application with Spring Boot.
    Most important are
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The dependencies in the pom.xml for Tobago, Spring Boot and Joinfaces. In this
    example, all dependencies are used, not the "starter" dependencies.</li>
    <li>The class TobagoApplication.java</li>
    <li>Facelets and other web-resources in META-INF/resources</li>
    <li>META-INF/application.yml</li>
    <li>tobago-config.xml</li>
  </ul>
</ui:composition>
