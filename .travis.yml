    # specifying other dists doesn't make sense because `trusty` doesn't have `oraclejdk8` (fails due to `Sorry, but JDK '[oraclejdk8]' is not known.`) which is the only supported JDK currently. Testing on Mac OSX doesn't make too much sense since it will run the same `maven` based build routine.

jdk:
- openjdk8
- oraclejdk8
- oraclejdk9
    # - list of available JDKs for trusty is at https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/reference/trusty/#JVM-(Clojure%2C-Groovy%2C-Java%2C-Scala)-images
    # - Java 7 fails due to `Tobago must be compiled with Java 8 or higher`
