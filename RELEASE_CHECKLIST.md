# Release Checklist

Checklist of tasks to perform for each release. For general information about Apache releases you may also consult
[Publishing Maven Releases](http://infra.apache.org/maven-releases.html).

## Preparation

* You need to add your GPG keys in [Subversion](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/myfaces/keys/KEYS) and
  the [Apache site](https://www.apache.org/dist/myfaces/KEYS) before a release. The SVN is read-only in general but the
  KEYS file can be committed. Change the [KEYS](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/myfaces/KEYS) file as it will
  be copied to the Apache site.
* Ensure that all open bugs and issues in [Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TOBAGO) have been either fixed or
  moved to another release version.
* Ensure that all examples are working with the release candidate.
* Since Tobago 5: Ensure that the script ./test-scenarios-locally.sh runs sucessfully.
* Check the scheduled version number against "semantic versioning".
* Post a note and ask for problems with the release candidate.
  > Subject: [Tobago] Preparation for the &lt;version> release
  >
  > Hi folks,
  >
  > we plan to build version &lt;version> of Tobago soon. If you know any blocking problems with the current SNAPSHOT,
  > give me a hint.
  >
  > Regards,
  > &lt;name>
* Ensure that there is no dependency with a SNAPSHOT version (e.g. for checkstyle-rules).
* Perform basic checks on an unmodified checkout for all modules. Use JDK 17 or higher for all builds.
  ```
  mvn clean install && mvn checkstyle:check apache-rat:check dependency-check:check
  ```

## Building the Release

* Do not use your forked repository for the following steps to keep the history of the release process.
* Commit: "chore(release): prepare" - check version info in these files manually (set to release version without
  SNAPSHOT suffix):
  * package.json
  * package-lock.json
  * package-info.java (check also version in comment)
  * Release.java (don't add new SNAPSHOT version)
  * ApiController.java
* Prepare the release with (the release-plugin make use of
  the [maven-gpg-plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-gpg-plugin/)):
  ```
  mvn release:prepare
  ```
* Make sure "apache.snapshots.https" and "apache.releases.https" servers are configured in settings.xml. Have a look
  at [Publishing Maven Releases](https://infra.apache.org/publishing-maven-artifacts.html) for more information. Then
  perform the release with:
  ```
  mvn release:perform
  ```
* Commit: "chore(release): set next SNAPSHOT version" - set next SNAPSHOT version in:
  * package.json
  * package-lock.json
  * package-info.java
  * Release.java (add new SNAPSHOT version)

## Staging repository

_Close_ the repository on the [Nexus](https://repository.apache.org/) instance for staging (you will receive a mail with
the staging location).

## Voting

* Propose a vote on the dev list with the staging location.
