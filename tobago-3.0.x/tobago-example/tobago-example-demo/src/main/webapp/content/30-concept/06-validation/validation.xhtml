  <p>Content validation of inputfields can be made directly in the facelet
    with the <code>required</code> attribute and several validation tags.</p>
  <p>Validation can also be described in the controller via annotations.</p>
  <p>In the context of validation, you may report errors to the user.
    The <code class="language-markup">&lt;tc:messages/></code> tag provide different severity levels.
    Have a look at
    <tc:link label="#{demoBundle.messages}"
