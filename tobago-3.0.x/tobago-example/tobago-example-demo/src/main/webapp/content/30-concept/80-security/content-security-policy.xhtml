  <ui:param name="title" value="Content Security Policy"/>

  Tobago supports Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent cross-site
  scripting (XSS) and related attacks.
  <tc:link link="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/" label="Specification link"/>.
  In short: The HTML page doesn't contain any JavaScript or CSS information.
  All allowed sources for JavaScript, CSS and other resources have to be declared in special header.
  If you have own renderers or own JavaScript in your application, this code also needs to support SCP, to use this feature.

    <tc:style maxWidth="400px"/>
    <tc:panel id="panel">
      <tc:out value="When you can read this text, it hasn't been manipulated by JavaScript.
        That means the CSP is working correctly."/>
    </tc:panel>
